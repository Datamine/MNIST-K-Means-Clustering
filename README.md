# MNIST-K-Means-Clustering
Using K-Means Clustering to Identify Handwritten Digits

Inspired by a homework assignment in John Lafferty's [Large-Scale Data Analysis](https://galton.uchicago.edu/~lafferty/37601-syllabus.pdf) course that I took at UChicago in the Spring of 2015. I collaborated with Elliott Ding on that assignment. In the class, we used distributed systems via AWS and Apache Spark, parallellized code, and did most analysis using map-reduce. To make the computational statistics more accessible, I've rewritten this notebook to not use distributed techniques.
